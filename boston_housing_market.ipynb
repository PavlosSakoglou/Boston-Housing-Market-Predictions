    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with 'Implementation' in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a 'Question X' header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with 'Answer:'. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",

    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or censored values and have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: 'RM', 'LSTAT', and 'PTRATIO'. For each data point (neighborhood):\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'RM' is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n",
    "* 'LSTAT' is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor).\n",
    "* 'PTRATIO' is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine things carefully:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Since these features reflect the quality and level of life in these neighborhoods,\n",
    "    it is natural to assume that possible increases or decreases in value will determine\n",
    "    the demand of the market over the houses, which will reflect in higher or lower\n",
    "    prices. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    An increase of the values of LSTAT feature, which represents the percentage \n",
    "    of lower class people living in a neighborhood, won't be approaching a \n",
    "    \"better neighborhood\" value, and as a result an increase of this feature more \n",
    "    likely will decrease the value of the house prices, since wealthy people, who \n",
    "    are willing to pay more, want to live in wealthier areas. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    An increase in RM i.e. if the average number of rooms per house increase, \n",
    "    which means if the size of the houses is getting bigger, will imply that the \n",
    "    neighborhood is wealthier, since large houses are found in wealthier areas. \n",
    "    That means, that the prices will also go up, as the size of the houses is \n",
    "    going up. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For the PTRATIO, if its values increase, it means that there are many students\n",
    "    per teacher, which means that on average the level of education is decreased. \n",
    "    Prestigious schools are famous for having small size classes so that the students\n",
    "    will get more individual attention by the teacher and thus comprehend the\n",
    "    material better. Non prestigious schools, like most public schools, are famous \n",
    "    (or infamous) for the opposite: large size classrooms, prioritizing quantity \n",
    "    over quality. Thus, increased PTRATIO values means the level of education \n",
    "    is decreasing, which means that wealthy potential buyers won't be much interested\n",
    "    in such neighborhoods cause they want their kids to go to good schools, \n",
    "    which in turn will decrease the demand, and as a result the prices of the \n",
    "    houses in these neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        As RM increases -> MEDV increases\n",

    "It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the coefficient of determination, R2, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how \"good\" that model is at making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values for R2 range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. A model with an R2 of 0 always fails to predict the target variable, whereas a model with an R2 of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the features. A model can be given a negative R2 as well, which indicates that the model is no better than one that naively predicts the mean of the target variable.\n",

Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable â€” i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the fit_model function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on."

    "On the other hand, the current factors are still pretty descriptive if we admit that\n",
